# Bubbles

This repository provides a trained SSD for detecting interstellar bubbles. The network base uses mobilenet.v1, trained on the coco dataset (coco_11_06_2017) and then further trained on Herschel HPDP images with labels from visual inspection on Spitzer images.  

In this repository you will find the trained model provided as a protobuf graph, example images and a python notebook used with google colab to apply the detection algorithm.
